### Area_gini -- Area_mean 

* the two orange lines in each subgraph are ideal gini lines of minimum household area (25, the value we set for insubstantial structures), mean household area (326, calculated). max household area (2015, calculated). 
* It's surprising to see that in general, the scattered points fit the shape of the ideal gini curves, and this means that in general, each cluster is composed of a number of high, middle, and poor households, and the area of each group is distinctive to others.
* This conclusion is supported by the histogram of households. If we consider bars with more than 10 entries, the whole graph could be characterized by 3 groups, corresponding to high, low, and middle status. 
* For all clustering algorithms (and different parameters), the majority of datapoints are mainly in the "bottom of the valley". Thie corresponds to the fact that the majority of datapoints are 
* [One remaining question]: why is the second ideal curve characterized by maximum household area rather than the mean area for the rich people.
